## Why whiteboard-infinity
As a developer or mentor, I am always struggled to find a way to descripe some idea during meetings or explain some technical problem on the fly. I just need a tool which can give me a place to do the sketch, in the meantime, I am not restricted by the space. Pixel/Bitmap based canvas will not meet the requirement, I am always blocked by the space. 

The only solution for this, is to build a vectorized space with minimum memory footprint, that's why I build this tool, and released it to Apple AppStore.
